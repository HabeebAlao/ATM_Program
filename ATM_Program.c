/*
Program Description: This is a simple menu driven C program that enables bank customers to manage, verify,
change their Personal Identification Number (PIN) on an Automated Teller Machine (ATM).
The PIN must be 4 digits or else the user is given an appropriate error message.
User also has the option to exit the program gracefully at will fromm within the program.

Development Environment: this program was developed in Visual Studio Code.
